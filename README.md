# todo-app
 
A basic todo app with CRUD operations available, the search bar will find the task by task name, the filter by complete buttons will show complete or uncompleted tasks, the arrow buttons will sort the task table alphabetically from ascending or descending, the update button will change the completed column from true to false and vice versa, and the delete button will delete the task from the api. Finally the create new task form on the bottom requires a task name and the completion status.
